#This program will demonstrate how we can create variables , use data types and obtain inputs
#dclare variables and assign values 
fullname="Mohamed Ali" #string
age=25 #integer
heightincm = 152.4 #float
homeowner=True #boolean, True or False must start with uppercase

print (fullname) #add a print statement to output of each variable 
print (age)
print (heightincm)
print (homeowner)

print ("My name is" + fullname) #CHALLENGE output the rest of the data in this format
print ("my age is" + str(age))
print ("my height is" + str(heightincm))
print (" I am a homeowner " + str(homeowner))

pet=input ("Do you own a pet?") #take an input from the user to make or program interactive 
#challenge can you add more questions? 
Car=input ("Do you have a car?:")
