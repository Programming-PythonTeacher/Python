#This program will demonstrate how we can store and manipulate a list (data structure)

shoppinglist1=["apples", "milk", "bread", "12 eggs"] #variable name and assign value using brackets
print ("How many items on the shopping list?")
print (len(shoppinglist1)) #print how many items are on the list

shoppinglist1.sort() #sort the lsit into alphabetical order

print(shoppinglist1)#output what the variable holds

#run your program here to see the results 
shoppinglist2=["cake", "biscuits", "chocolate"] #varibale name and assign vlaue using brackets
shoppinglist2.sort(reverse=True)#reverse order list items, remember True needs to start witha  capital letter
for x in shoppinglist2: # output all items one by one until no more
 print (x)
 
#run your program here to see the results
fulllist=shoppinglist1 + shoppinglist2 # use + operator to join lists together and store new variable 
#print (fulllist)

#runyour program here to see the results
#challenge can you sort list alphabetically, list items one by one and print how many items are in the list? 
fulllist.sort() #(reverse=False)
for b in fulllist:
 print (b)
